E-Step &amp; Multiplier Calculator

Hi.

As i am a noob on python, dont expect much...

I was bored an decided to make a simple windows app to calculate e-steps for my 3d printers.
The app is made with python and is pre compiled for windows, altho the source can be compiled for Linux and Mac too.

ps.
To be able to use the calculator you have to know the rutine in calculating e-steps,

The pre compiled exe has been tested on Windows 10 64bit.
It is free to use/copy/share etc.
