E-Step &amp; Multiplier Calculator

Hi.

As i am a noob on python, dont expect much...

I was bored an decided to make a simple windows app to calculate e-steps for my 3d printers. <br>
The app is made with python and is pre compiled for windows, altho the source can be compiled for Linux and Mac too. <br>

ps. <br>
To be able to use the calculator you have to know the rutine in calculating e-steps, <br>
if you dont go here first: https://mattshub.com/blogs/blog/extruder-calibration

The pre compiled exe has been tested on Windows 10 64bit. <br>
It is free to use/copy/share etc.

Have fun, Bajotaz
